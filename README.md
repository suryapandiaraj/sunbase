This is an assignment by Sunbase to develop a Full Stack Web Application. I have used **Java Spring boot** for backend and **HTML/CSS** and **Javascript** or frontend. Have **defined roles** for users so that not everyone can access or alter the database. Only **authorized users** can. Have attached snapshots of frontend.
